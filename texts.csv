id,text1,"The International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) is a consortium for characterizing the genetic landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The identified and/or confirmed 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AD are located on non-coding DNA regions, and their functional impacts on AD are as yet poorly understood. We evaluated the roles of the IGAP SNPs by integrating data from many resources, based on whether the IGAP SNP was (1) a proxy for a coding SNP or (2) associated with altered mRNA transcript levels. For (1), we confirmed that 12 AD-associated coding common SNPs and five nonsynonymous rare variants are in linkage disequilibrium with the IGAP SNPs. For (2), the IGAP SNPs in CELF1 and MS4A6A were associated with expression of their neighboring genes, MYBPC3 and MS4A6A, respectively, in blood. The IGAP SNP in DSG2 was an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for DLGAP1 and NETO1 in the human frontal cortex. The IGAP SNPs in ABCA7, CD2AP, and CD33 each acted as eQTL for AD-associated genes in brain. Our approach for identifying proxies and examining eQTL highlighted potentially impactful, novel gene regulatory phenomena pertinent to the AD phenotype."2,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the interplay of multiple genetic and non-genetic factors. Hypertension is one of the AD risk factors that has been linked to underlying pathological changes like senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation as well as hippocampal atrophy. In this study, we investigated the differences in the genetic architecture of AD between hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects in four independent cohorts. Our genome-wide association analyses revealed significant associations of 15 novel potentially AD-associated polymorphisms (P < 5E-06) that were located outside the chromosome 19q13 region and were significant either in hypertensive or non-hypertensive groups. The closest genes to 14 polymorphisms were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Also, four of them were located within two chromosomal regions (i.e., 3q13.11 and 17q21.2) that were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 before. In addition, 30 genes demonstrated evidence of group-specific associations with AD at the false discovery rates (FDR) < 0.05 in our gene-based and transcriptome-wide association analyses. The chromosomal regions corresponding to four genes (i.e., 2p13.1, 9p13.3, 17q12, and 18q21.1) were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 in previous GWAS. These genes may serve as a list of prioritized candidates for future functional studies. Our pathway-enrichment analyses revealed the associations of 11 non-group-specific and four group-specific pathways with AD at FDR < 0.05. These findings provided novel insights into the potential genetic heterogeneity of AD among subjects with and without hypertension."3,"The risk of APOE for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is modified by age. Beyond APOE, the polygenic architecture may also be heterogeneous across age. We aim to investigate age-related genetic heterogeneity of AD and identify genomic loci with differential effects across age. Stratified gene-based genome-wide association studies and polygenic variation analyses were performed in the younger (60-79 years, N = 14,895) and older (≥80 years, N = 6559) age-at-onset groups using Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium data. We showed a moderate genetic correlation (rg = 0.64) between the two age groups, supporting genetic heterogeneity. Heritability explained by variants on chromosome 19 (harboring APOE) was significantly larger in younger than in older onset group (p < 0.05). APOE region, BIN1, OR2S2, MS4A4E, and PICALM were identified at the gene-based genome-wide significance (p < 2.73 × 10-6) with larger effects at younger age (except MS4A4E). For the novel gene OR2S2, we further performed leave-one-out analyses, which showed consistent effects across subsamples. Our results suggest using genetically more homogeneous individuals may help detect additional susceptible loci."4,"Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Aβ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 × 10-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education."5,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable and recent studies have identified over 20 disease-associated genomic loci. Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (rg = 0.81). Meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci, implicating 215 potential causative genes. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver, and microglia). Gene-set analyses indicate biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in identifying the genetic factors that contribute to AD risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD."6,"Cardiovascular (CV)- and lifestyle-associated risk factors (RFs) are increasingly recognized as important for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Beyond the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), comparatively little is known about whether CV-associated genes also increase risk for AD. Using large genome-wide association studies and validated tools to quantify genetic overlap, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with AD and one or more CV-associated RFs, namely body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD), waist hip ratio (WHR), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In fold enrichment plots, we observed robust genetic enrichment in AD as a function of plasma lipids (TG, TC, LDL, and HDL); we found minimal AD genetic enrichment conditional on BMI, T2D, CAD, and WHR. Beyond APOE, at conjunction FDR < 0.05 we identified 90 SNPs on 19 different chromosomes that were jointly associated with AD and CV-associated outcomes. In meta-analyses across three independent cohorts, we found four novel loci within MBLAC1 (chromosome 7, meta-p = 1.44 x 10(-9)), MINK1 (chromosome 17, meta-p = 1.98 x 10(-7)) and two chromosome 11 SNPs within the MTCH2/SPI1 region (closest gene = DDB2, meta-p = 7.01 x 10(-7) and closest gene = MYBPC3, meta-p = 5.62 x 10(-8)). In a large 'AD-by-proxy' cohort from the UK Biobank, we replicated three of the four novel AD/CV pleiotropic SNPs, namely variants within MINK1, MBLAC1, and DDB2. Expression of MBLAC1, SPI1, MINK1 and DDB2 was differentially altered within postmortem AD brains. Beyond APOE, we show that the polygenic component of AD is enriched for lipid-associated RFs. We pinpoint a subset of cardiovascular-associated genes that strongly increase the risk for AD. Our collective findings support a disease model in which cardiovascular biology is integral to the development of clinical AD in a subset of individuals."7,"A growing number of studies clearly demonstrate a substantial link between metabolic dysfunction and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially glucose-related dysfunction; one hypothesis for this comorbidity is the presence of a common genetic etiology. We conducted a large-scale cross-trait GWAS to investigate the genetic overlap between AD and ten metabolic traits. Among all the metabolic traits, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HDL were found to be genetically associated with AD. Local genetic covariance analysis found that 19q13 region had strong local genetic correlation between AD and T2D (P = 6.78 x 10(- 22)), LDL (P = 1.74 x 10(- 253)) and HDL (P = 7.94 x 10(- 18)). Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 4 loci that were associated with AD and fasting glucose, 3 loci that were associated with AD and fasting insulin, and 20 loci that were associated with AD and HDL (Pmeta < 1.6 x 10(- 8), single trait P < 0.05). Functional analysis revealed that the shared genes are enriched in amyloid metabolic process, lipoprotein remodeling and other related biological pathways; also in pancreas, liver, blood and other tissues. Our work identifies common genetic architectures shared between AD and fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HDL, and sheds light on molecular mechanisms underlying the association between metabolic dysregulation and AD."8," Alzheimer's disease (AD) and bipolar disorder (BIP) are complex traits influenced by numerous common genetic variants, most of which remain to be detected. Clinical and epidemiological evidence suggest that AD and BIP are related. However, it is not established if this relation is of genetic origin. Here, we applied statistical methods based on the conditional false discovery rate (FDR) framework to detect genetic overlap between AD and BIP and utilized this overlap to increase the power to identify common genetic variants associated with either or both traits. Methods: We obtained genome wide association studies data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project part 1 (17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls) and the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium Bipolar Disorder Working Group (20,352 BIP cases and 31,358 controls). We used conditional QQ-plots to assess overlap in common genetic variants between AD and BIP. We exploited the genetic overlap to re-rank test-statistics for AD and BIP and improve detection of genetic variants using the conditional FDR framework. Results: Conditional QQ-plots demonstrated a polygenic overlap between AD and BIP. Using conditional FDR, we identified one novel genomic locus associated with AD, and nine novel loci associated with BIP. Further, we identified two novel loci jointly associated with AD and BIP implicating the MARK2 gene (lead SNP rs10792421, conjunctional FDR = 0.030, same direction of effect) and the VAC14 gene (lead SNP rs11649476, conjunctional FDR = 0.022, opposite direction of effect). Conclusion: We found polygenic overlap between AD and BIP and identified novel loci for each trait and two jointly associated loci. Further studies should examine if the shared loci implicating the MARK2 and VAC14 genes could explain parts of the shared and distinct features of AD and BIP."9,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. AD is mainly considered a complex disorder with polygenic inheritance. Despite discovering many susceptibility loci, a major proportion of AD genetic variance remains to be explained. METHODS: We investigated the genetic architecture of AD in four publicly available independent datasets through genome-wide association, transcriptome-wide association, and gene-based and pathway-based analyses. To explore differences in the genetic basis of AD between males and females, analyses were performed on three samples in each dataset: males and females combined, only males, or only females. RESULTS: Our genome-wide association analyses corroborated the associations of several previously detected AD loci and revealed novel significant associations of 35 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) outside the chromosome 19q13 region at the suggestive significance level of p < 5E-06. These SNPs were mapped to 21 genes in 19 chromosomal regions. Of these, 17 genes were not associated with AD at genome-wide or suggestive levels of associations by previous genome-wide association studies. Also, the chromosomal regions corresponding to 8 genes did not contain any previously detected AD-associated SNPs with p < 5E-06. Our transcriptome-wide association and gene-based analyses revealed that 26 genes located in 20 chromosomal regions outside chromosome 19q13 had evidence of potential associations with AD at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Of these, 13 genes/regions did not contain any previously AD-associated SNPs at genome-wide or suggestive levels of associations. Most of the newly detected AD-associated SNPs and genes were sex specific, indicating sex disparities in the genetic basis of AD. Also, 7 of 26 pathways that showed evidence of associations with AD in our pathway-bases analyses were significant only in females. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, particularly the newly discovered sex-specific genetic contributors, provide novel insight into the genetic architecture of AD and can advance our understanding of its pathogenesis."10,"Objective: To explore genetic and lifestyle risk factors of MRI-defined brain infarcts (BI) in large population-based cohorts.

Methods: We performed meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and examined associations of vascular risk factors and their genetic risk scores (GRS) with MRI-defined BI and a subset of BI, namely, small subcortical BI (SSBI), in 18 population-based cohorts (n = 20,949) from 5 ethnicities (3,726 with BI, 2,021 with SSBI). Top loci were followed up in 7 population-based cohorts (n = 6,862; 1,483 with BI, 630 with SBBI), and we tested associations with related phenotypes including ischemic stroke and pathologically defined BI.

Results: The mean prevalence was 17.7% for BI and 10.5% for SSBI, steeply rising after age 65. Two loci showed genome-wide significant association with BI: FBN2, p = 1.77 × 10-8; and LINC00539/ZDHHC20, p = 5.82 × 10-9. Both have been associated with blood pressure (BP)-related phenotypes, but did not replicate in the smaller follow-up sample or show associations with related phenotypes. Age- and sex-adjusted associations with BI and SSBI were observed for BP traits (p value for BI, p [BI] = 9.38 × 10-25; p [SSBI] = 5.23 × 10-14 for hypertension), smoking (p [BI] = 4.4 × 10-10; p [SSBI] = 1.2 × 10-4), diabetes (p [BI] = 1.7 × 10-8; p [SSBI] = 2.8 × 10-3), previous cardiovascular disease (p [BI] = 1.0 × 10-18; p [SSBI] = 2.3 × 10-7), stroke (p [BI] = 3.9 × 10-69; p [SSBI] = 3.2 × 10-24), and MRI-defined white matter hyperintensity burden (p [BI] = 1.43 × 10-157; p [SSBI] = 3.16 × 10-106), but not with body mass index or cholesterol. GRS of BP traits were associated with BI and SSBI (p ≤ 0.0022), without indication of directional pleiotropy.

Conclusion: In this multiethnic GWAS meta-analysis, including over 20,000 population-based participants, we identified genetic risk loci for BI requiring validation once additional large datasets become available. High BP, including genetically determined, was the most significant modifiable, causal risk factor for BI."11,"Variants in the APOE gene region may explain ethnic differences in the association of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with epsilon4. Ethnic differences in allele frequencies for three APOE region SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) were identified and tested for association in 19,398 East Asians (EastA), including Koreans and Japanese, 15,836 European ancestry (EuroA) individuals, and 4985 African Americans, and with brain imaging measures of cortical atrophy in sub-samples of Koreans and EuroAs. Among epsilon4/epsilon4 individuals, AD risk increased substantially in a dose-dependent manner with the number of APOE promoter SNP rs405509 T alleles in EastAs (TT: OR (odds ratio) = 27.02, p = 8.80 x 10(-94); GT: OR = 15.87, p = 2.62 x 10(-9)) and EuroAs (TT: OR = 18.13, p = 2.69 x 10(-108); GT: OR = 12.63, p = 3.44 x 10(-64)), and rs405509-T homozygotes had a younger onset and more severe cortical atrophy than those with G-allele. Functional experiments using APOE promoter fragments demonstrated that TT lowered APOE expression in human brain and serum. The modifying effect of rs405509 genotype explained much of the ethnic variability in the AD/epsilon4 association, and increasing APOE expression might lower AD risk among epsilon4 homozygotes."12,"Autopsy measures of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology have been leveraged as endophenotypes in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, despite evidence of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease risk, sex-stratified models have not been incorporated into previous GWAS analyses. We looked for sex-specific genetic associations with Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes from six brain bank data repositories. The pooled dataset included 2701 males and 3275 females, the majority of whom were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at autopsy (70%). Sex-stratified GWAS were performed within each dataset and then meta-analysed. Loci that reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8) in stratified models were further assessed for sex interactions. Additional analyses were performed in independent datasets leveraging cognitive, neuroimaging and CSF endophenotypes, along with age-at-onset data. Outside of the APOE region, one locus on chromosome 7 (rs34331204) showed a sex-specific association with neurofibrillary tangles among males (P = 2.5 x 10-8) but not females (P = 0.85, sex-interaction P = 2.9 x 10-4). In follow-up analyses, rs34331204 was also associated with hippocampal volume, executive function, and age-at-onset only among males. These results implicate a novel locus that confers male-specific protection from tau pathology and highlight the value of assessing genetic associations in a sex-specific manner."13,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a public health priority for the 21st century. Risk reduction currently revolves around lifestyle changes with much research trying to elucidate the biological underpinnings. We show that self-report of parental history of Alzheimer's dementia for case ascertainment in a genome-wide association study of 314,278 participants from UK Biobank (27,696 maternal cases, 14,338 paternal cases) is a valid proxy for an AD genetic study. After meta-analysing with published consortium data (n = 74,046 with 25,580 cases across the discovery and replication analyses), three new AD-associated loci (P < 5 x 10(-8)) are identified. These contain genes relevant for AD and neurodegeneration: ADAM10, BCKDK/KAT8 and ACE. Novel gene-based loci include drug targets such as VKORC1 (warfarin dose). We report evidence that the association of SNPs in the TOMM40 gene with AD is potentially mediated by both gene expression and DNA methylation in the prefrontal cortex. However, it is likely that multiple variants are affecting the trait and gene methylation/expression. Our discovered loci may help to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying AD and, as they contain genes that are drug targets for other diseases and disorders, warrant further exploration for potential precision medicine applications."14,"Despite evident success in clarifying many important features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) the efficient methods of its prevention and treatment are not yet available. The reasons are likely to be the fact that AD is a multifactorial and heterogeneous health disorder with multiple alternative pathways of disease development and progression. The availability of genetic data on individuals participated in longitudinal studies of aging health and longevity, as well as on participants of cross-sectional case-control studies allow for investigating genetic and non-genetic connections with AD and to link the results of these analyses with research findings obtained in clinical, experimental, and molecular biological studies of this health disorder. The objective of this paper is to perform GWAS of AD in several study populations and investigate possible roles of detected genetic factors in developing AD hallmarks and in other health disorders. The data collected in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study (LOADFS) were used in these analyses. The logistic regression and Cox's regression were used as statistical models in GWAS. The results of analyses confirmed strong associations of genetic variants from well-known genes APOE, TOMM40, PVRL2 (NECTIN2), and APOC1 with AD. Possible roles of these genes in pathological mechanisms resulting in development of hallmarks of AD are described. Many genes whose connection with AD was detected in other studies showed nominally significant associations with this health disorder in our study. The evidence on genetic connections between AD and vulnerability to infection, as well as between AD and other health disorders, such as cancer and type 2 diabetes, were investigated. The progress in uncovering hidden heterogeneity in AD would be substantially facilitated if common mechanisms involved in development of AD, its hallmarks, and AD related chronic conditions were investigated in their mutual connection."15,"INTRODUCTION: Because currently known Alzheimer's disease (AD) single-nucleotide polymorphisms only account for a small fraction of the genetic variance in this disease, there is a need to identify new variants associated with AD. METHODS: Our team performed a genome-wide association study in the Quebec Founder Population isolate to identify novel protective or risk genetic factors for late-onset sporadic AD and examined the impact of these variants on gene expression and AD pathology. RESULTS: The rs10984186 variant is associated with an increased risk of developing AD and with a higher CDK5RAP2 mRNA prevalence in the hippocampus. On the other hand, the rs4837766 variant, which is among the best cis-expression quantitative trait loci in the CDK5RAP2 gene, is associated with lower mild cognitive impairment/AD risk and conversion rate. DISCUSSION: The rs10984186 risk and rs4837766 protective polymorphic variants of the CDK5RAP2 gene might act as potent genetic modifiers for AD risk and/or conversion by modulating the expression of this gene."16,"INTRODUCTION: Genetic associations for endophenotypes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in cognitive stages preceding AD have not been thoroughly evaluated. METHODS: We conducted genome-wide association studies for AD-related endophenotypes including hippocampal volume, logical memory scores, and cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 and total/phosphorylated tau in cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment, and AD dementia subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. RESULTS: In CN subjects, study-wide significant (P < 8.3 x 10(-9)) loci were identified for total tau near SRRM4 and C14orf79 and for hippocampal volume near MTUS1. In mild cognitive impairment subjects, study-wide significant association was found with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near ZNF804B for logical memory test of delayed recall scores. We found consistent expression patterns of C14orf40 and MTUS1 in carriers with risk alleles of expression SNPs and in brains of AD patients, compared with in the noncarriers and in brains of controls. DISCUSSION: Our findings for AD-related brain changes before AD provide insight about early AD-related biological processes."17,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) and tau have been evaluated as endophenotypes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic studies. Although there are sex differences in AD risk, sex differences have not been evaluated in genetic studies of AD endophenotypes. We performed sex-stratified and sex interaction genetic analyses of CSF biomarkers to identify sex-specific associations. Data came from a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CSF Abeta42 and tau (1527 males, 1509 females). We evaluated sex interactions at previous loci, performed sex-stratified GWAS to identify sex-specific associations, and evaluated sex interactions at sex-specific GWAS loci. We then evaluated sex-specific associations between prefrontal cortex (PFC) gene expression at relevant loci and autopsy measures of plaques and tangles using data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In Abeta42, we observed sex interactions at one previous and one novel locus: rs316341 within SERPINB1 (p = 0.04) and rs13115400 near LINC00290 (p = 0.002). These loci showed stronger associations among females (beta = - 0.03, p = 4.25 x 10(-8); beta = 0.03, p = 3.97 x 10(-8)) than males (beta = - 0.02, p = 0.009; beta = 0.01, p = 0.20). Higher levels of expression of SERPINB1, SERPINB6, and SERPINB9 in PFC was associated with higher levels of amyloidosis among females (corrected p values < 0.02) but not males (p > 0.38). In total tau, we observed a sex interaction at a previous locus, rs1393060 proximal to GMNC (p = 0.004), driven by a stronger association among females (beta = 0.05, p = 4.57 x 10(-10)) compared to males (beta = 0.02, p = 0.03). There was also a sex-specific association between rs1393060 and tangle density at autopsy (pfemale = 0.047; pmale = 0.96), and higher levels of expression of two genes within this locus were associated with lower tangle density among females (OSTN p = 0.006; CLDN16 p = 0.002) but not males (p >/= 0.32). Results suggest a female-specific role for SERPINB1 in amyloidosis and for OSTN and CLDN16 in tau pathology. Sex-specific genetic analyses may improve understanding of AD's genetic architecture."18,"Background: Simultaneous consideration of two neuropathological traits related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been attempted in a genome-wide association study.

Methods: We conducted genome-wide pleiotropy analyses using association summary statistics from the Beecham et al. study (PLoS Genet 10:e1004606, 2014) for AD-related neuropathological traits, including neuritic plaque (NP), neurofibrillary tangle (NFT), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Significant findings were further examined by expression quantitative trait locus and differentially expressed gene analyses in AD vs. control brains using gene expression data.

Results: Genome-wide significant pleiotropic associations were observed for the joint model of NP and NFT (NP + NFT) with the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs34487851 upstream of C2orf40 (alias ECRG4, P = 2.4 × 10-8) and for the joint model of NFT and CAA (NFT + CAA) with the HDAC9 SNP rs79524815 (P = 1.1 × 10-8). Gene-based testing revealed study-wide significant associations (P ≤ 2.0 × 10-6) for the NFT + CAA outcome with adjacent genes TRAPPC12, TRAPPC12-AS1, and ADI1. Risk alleles of proxy SNPs for rs79524815 were associated with significantly lower expression of HDAC9 in the brain (P = 3.0 × 10-3), and HDAC9 was significantly downregulated in subjects with AD compared with control subjects in the prefrontal (P = 7.9 × 10-3) and visual (P = 5.6 × 10-4) cortices.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that pleiotropy analysis is a useful approach to identifying novel genetic associations with complex diseases and their endophenotypes. Functional studies are needed to determine whether ECRG4 or HDAC9 is plausible as a therapeutic target.

Although novel ALS genetic variants have been identified, the shared genetic risk between ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders remains poorly understood. Objectives: To examine whether there are common genetic variants that determine the risk for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases and to identify their functional pathways. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this study conducted from December 1, 2016, to August 1, 2017, the genetic overlap between ALS, sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD), FTD with TDP-43 inclusions, Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) were systematically investigated in 124876 cases and controls. No participants were excluded from this study. Diagnoses were established using consensus criteria. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were a list of novel loci and their functional pathways in ALS, FTD, PSP, and ALS mouse models. Results: Among 124876 cases and controls, genome-wide conjunction analyses of ALS, FTD, PD, AD, CBD, and PSP revealed significant genetic overlap between ALS and FTD at known ALS loci: rs13302855 and rs3849942 (nearest gene, C9orf72; P = .03 for rs13302855 and P = .005 for rs3849942) and rs4239633 (nearest gene, UNC13A; P = .03). Significant genetic overlap was also found between ALS and PSP at rs7224296, which tags the MAPT H1 haplotype (nearest gene, NSF; P = .045). Shared risk genes were enriched for pathways involving neuronal function and development. At a conditional FDR P < .05, 22 novel ALS polymorphisms were found, including rs538622 (nearest gene, ERGIC1; P = .03 for ALS and FTD), which modifies BNIP1 expression in human brains (35 of 137 females; mean age, 59 years; P = .001). BNIP1 expression was significantly reduced in spinal cord motor neurons from patients with ALS (4 controls: mean age, 60.5 years, mean [SE] value, 3984 [760.8] arbitrary units [AU]; 7 patients with ALS: mean age, 56 years, mean [SE] value, 1999 [274.1] AU; P = .02), in an ALS mouse model (mean [SE] value, 13.75 [0.09] AU for 2 SOD1 WT mice and 11.45 [0.03] AU for 2 SOD1 G93A mice; P = .002) and in brains of patients with PSP (80 controls: 39 females; mean age, 82 years, mean [SE] value, 6.8 [0.2] AU; 84 patients with PSP: 33 females, mean age 74 years, mean [SE] value, 6.8 [0.1] AU; beta = -0.19; P = .009) or FTD (11 controls: 4 females; mean age, 67 years; mean [SE] value, 6.74 [0.05] AU; 17 patients with FTD: 10 females; mean age, 69 years; mean [SE] value, 6.53 [0.04] AU; P = .005). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found novel genetic overlap between ALS and diseases of the FTD spectrum, that the MAPT H1 haplotype confers risk for ALS, and identified the mitophagy-associated, proapoptotic protein BNIP1 as an ALS risk gene. Together, these findings suggest that sporadic ALS may represent a selectively pleiotropic, polygenic disorder."20,"Depression is one of the most frequent psychiatric symptoms observed in people during the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that genetic factors conferring risk of depression might affect AD development. In this study, we screened 31 genes, which were located in 19 risk loci for major depressive disorder (MDD) identified by two recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS), in AD patients at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. Association analysis of common variants was performed by using summary statistics of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), and association analysis of rare variants was conducted by sequencing the entire coding region of the 31 MDD risk genes in 107 Han Chinese patients with early-onset and/or familial AD. We also quantified the mRNA expression alterations of these MDD risk genes in brain tissues of AD patients and AD mouse models, followed by protein-protein interaction network prediction to show their potential effects in AD pathways. We found that common and rare variants of L3MBTL2 were significantly associated with AD. mRNA expression levels of 18 MDD risk genes, in particular SORCS3 and OAT, were differentially expressed in AD brain tissues. 13 MDD risk genes were predicted to physically interact with core AD genes. The involvement of HACE1, NEGR1, and SLC6A15 in AD was supported by convergent lines of evidence. Taken together, our results showed that MDD risk genes might play an active role in AD pathology and supported the notion that depression might be the ""common cold"" of psychiatry."21,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Structural integrity of the white matter is a marker of cerebral small vessel disease, which is the major cause of vascular dementia and a quarter of all strokes. Genetic studies provide a way to obtain novel insights in the disease mechanism underlying cerebral small vessel disease. The aim was to identify common variants associated with microstructural integrity of the white matter and to elucidate the relationships of white matter structural integrity with stroke, major depressive disorder, and Alzheimer disease. METHODS: This genome-wide association analysis included 8448 individuals from UK Biobank-a population-based cohort study that recruited individuals from across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010, aged 40 to 69 years. Microstructural integrity was measured as fractional anisotropy- (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)-derived parameters on diffusion tensor images. White matter hyperintensity volumes (WMHV) were assessed on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. RESULTS: We identified 1 novel locus at genome-wide significance (VCAN [versican]: rs13164785; P=3.7x10(-18) for MD and rs67827860; P=1.3x10(-14) for FA). LD score regression showed a significant genome-wide correlation between FA, MD, and WMHV (FA-WMHV rG 0.39 [SE, 0.15]; MD-WMHV rG 0.56 [SE, 0.19]). In polygenic risk score analysis, FA, MD, and WMHV were significantly associated with lacunar stroke, MD with major depressive disorder, and WMHV with Alzheimer disease. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants within the VCAN gene may play a role in the mechanisms underlying microstructural integrity of the white matter in the brain measured as FA and MD. Mechanisms underlying white matter alterations are shared with cerebrovascular disease, and inherited differences in white matter microstructure impact on Alzheimer disease and major depressive disorder."22,"BACKGROUND: Clinical, pathological and genetic overlap between sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been suggested; however, the relationship between these disorders is still not well understood. Here we evaluated genetic overlap between FTD, AD and PD to assess shared pathobiology and identify novel genetic variants associated with increased risk for FTD. METHODS: Summary statistics were obtained from the International FTD Genomics Consortium, International PD Genetics Consortium and International Genomics of AD Project (n>75 000 cases and controls). We used conjunction false discovery rate (FDR) to evaluate genetic pleiotropy and conditional FDR to identify novel FTD-associated SNPs. Relevant variants were further evaluated for expression quantitative loci. RESULTS: We observed SNPs within the HLA, MAPT and APOE regions jointly contributing to increased risk for FTD and AD or PD. By conditioning on polymorphisms associated with PD and AD, we found 11 loci associated with increased risk for FTD. Meta-analysis across two independent FTD cohorts revealed a genome-wide signal within the APOE region (rs6857, 3'-UTR=PVRL2, p=2.21x10(-12)), and a suggestive signal for rs1358071 within the MAPT region (intronic=CRHR1, p=4.91x10(-7)) with the effect allele tagging the H1 haplotype. Pleiotropic SNPs at the HLA and MAPT loci associated with expression changes in cis-genes supporting involvement of intracellular vesicular trafficking, immune response and endo/lysosomal processes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate genetic pleiotropy in these neurodegenerative diseases and indicate that sporadic FTD is a polygenic disorder where multiple pleiotropic loci with small effects contribute to increased disease risk."23,"INTRODUCTION: The growing public threat of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised the urgency to quantify the degree of cognitive decline during the conversion process of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD and its underlying genetic pathway. The aim of this article was to test genetic common variants associated with accelerated cognitive decline after the conversion of MCI to AD. METHODS: In 583 subjects with MCI enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; ADNI-1, ADNI-Go, and ADNI-2), 245 MCI participants converted to AD at follow-up. We tested the interaction effects between individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms and AD diagnosis trajectory on the longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition scores. RESULTS: Our findings reveal six genes, including BDH1, ST6GAL1, RAB20, PDS5B, ADARB2, and SPSB1, which are directly or indirectly related to MCI conversion to AD. DISCUSSION: This genome-wide association study sheds light on a genetic mechanism of longitudinal cognitive changes during the transition period from MCI to AD."24,"We identified rare coding variants associated with Alzheimer's disease in a three-stage case-control study of 85,133 subjects. In stage 1, we genotyped 34,174 samples using a whole-exome microarray. In stage 2, we tested associated variants (P < 1 x 10(-4)) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes. In stage 3, we used an additional 14,997 samples to test the most significant stage 2 associations (P < 5 x 10(-8)) using imputed genotypes. We observed three new genome-wide significant nonsynonymous variants associated with Alzheimer's disease: a protective variant in PLCG2 (rs72824905: p.Pro522Arg, P = 5.38 x 10(-10), odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, minor allele frequency (MAF)cases = 0.0059, MAFcontrols = 0.0093), a risk variant in ABI3 (rs616338: p.Ser209Phe, P = 4.56 x 10(-10), OR = 1.43, MAFcases = 0.011, MAFcontrols = 0.008), and a new genome-wide significant variant in TREM2 (rs143332484: p.Arg62His, P = 1.55 x 10(-14), OR = 1.67, MAFcases = 0.0143, MAFcontrols = 0.0089), a known susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease. These protein-altering changes are in genes highly expressed in microglia and highlight an immune-related protein-protein interaction network enriched for previously identified risk genes in Alzheimer's disease. These genetic findings provide additional evidence that the microglia-mediated innate immune response contributes directly to the development of Alzheimer's disease."25,"BACKGROUND: Identifying individuals at risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD) is of utmost importance. Although genetic studies have identified AD-associated SNPs in APOE and other genes, genetic information has not been integrated into an epidemiological framework for risk prediction. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using genotype data from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP Stage 1), we identified AD-associated SNPs (at p < 10-5). We then integrated these AD-associated SNPs into a Cox proportional hazard model using genotype data from a subset of 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1 of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), providing a polygenic hazard score (PHS) for each participant. By combining population-based incidence rates and the genotype-derived PHS for each individual, we derived estimates of instantaneous risk for developing AD, based on genotype and age, and tested replication in multiple independent cohorts (ADGC Phase 2, National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Center [NIA ADC], and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], total n = 20,680). Within the ADGC Phase 1 cohort, individuals in the highest PHS quartile developed AD at a considerably lower age and had the highest yearly AD incidence rate. Among APOE epsilon3/3 individuals, the PHS modified expected age of AD onset by more than 10 y between the lowest and highest deciles (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% CI 2.62-4.24, p = 1.0 x 10-22). In independent cohorts, the PHS strongly predicted empirical age of AD onset (ADGC Phase 2, r = 0.90, p = 1.1 x 10-26) and longitudinal progression from normal aging to AD (NIA ADC, Cochran-Armitage trend test, p = 1.5 x 10-10), and was associated with neuropathology (NIA ADC, Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangles, p = 3.9 x 10-6, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score for neuritic plaques, p = 6.8 x 10-6) and in vivo markers of AD neurodegeneration (ADNI, volume loss within the entorhinal cortex, p = 6.3 x 10-6, and hippocampus, p = 7.9 x 10-5). Additional prospective validation of these results in non-US, non-white, and prospective community-based cohorts is necessary before clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a PHS for quantifying individual differences in age-specific genetic risk for AD. Within the cohorts studied here, polygenic architecture plays an important role in modifying AD risk beyond APOE. With thorough validation, quantification of inherited genetic variation may prove useful for stratifying AD risk and as an enrichment strategy in therapeutic trials."26,"More than 20 genetic loci have been associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but reported genome-wide significant loci do not account for all the estimated heritability and provide little information about underlying biological mechanisms. Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or endophenotypes, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted GWAS of amyloid beta (Abeta42), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 3146 participants across nine studies to identify novel variants associated with AD. Five genome-wide significant loci (two novel) were associated with ptau181, including loci that have also been associated with AD risk or brain-related phenotypes. Two novel loci associated with Abeta42 near GLIS1 on 1p32.3 (beta = -0.059, P = 2.08 x 10(-8)) and within SERPINB1 on 6p25 (beta = -0.025, P = 1.72 x 10(-8)) were also associated with AD risk (GLIS1: OR = 1.105, P = 3.43 x 10(-2)), disease progression (GLIS1: beta = 0.277, P = 1.92 x 10(-2)), and age at onset (SERPINB1: beta = 0.043, P = 4.62 x 10(-3)). Bioinformatics indicate that the intronic SERPINB1 variant (rs316341) affects expression of SERPINB1 in various tissues, including the hippocampus, suggesting that SERPINB1 influences AD through an Abeta-associated mechanism. Analyses of known AD risk loci suggest CLU and FERMT2 may influence CSF Abeta42 (P = 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively) and the INPP5D locus may affect ptau181 levels (P = 0.009); larger studies are necessary to verify these results. Together the findings from this study can be used to inform future AD studies."27,"Growing evidence from both epidemiology and basic science suggest an inverse association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer. We examined the genetic relationship between AD and various cancer types using GWAS summary statistics from the IGAP and GAME-ON consortia. Sample size ranged from 9931 to 54,162; SNPs were imputed to the 1000 Genomes European panel. Our results based on cross-trait LD Score regression showed a significant positive genetic correlation between AD and five cancers combined (colon, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung; r g = 0.17, P = 0.04), and specifically with breast cancer (ER-negative and overall; r g = 0.21 and 0.18, P = 0.035 and 0.034) and lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and overall; r g = 0.31, 0.38 and 0.30, P = 0.029, 0.016, and 0.006). Estimating the genetic correlation in specific functional categories revealed mixed positive and negative signals, notably stronger at annotations associated with increased enhancer activity. This suggests a role of gene expression regulators in the shared genetic etiology between AD and cancer, and that some shared variants modulate disease risk concordantly while others have effects in opposite directions. Due to power issues, we did not detect cross-phenotype associations at individual SNPs. This genetic overlap is not likely driven by a handful of major loci. Our study is the first to examine the co-heritability of AD and cancer leveraging large-scale GWAS results. The functional categories highlighted in this study need further investigation to illustrate the details of the genetic sharing and to bridge between different levels of associations."28,"INTRODUCTION: African Americans' (AAs) late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) genetic risk profile is incompletely understood. Including clinical covariates in genetic analyses using informed conditioning might improve study power. METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in AAs employing informed conditioning in 1825 LOAD cases and 3784 cognitively normal controls. We derived a posterior liability conditioned on age, sex, diabetes status, current smoking status, educational attainment, and affection status, with parameters informed by external prevalence information. We assessed association between the posterior liability and a genome-wide set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), controlling for APOE and ABCA7, identified previously in a LOAD GWAS of AAs. RESULTS: Two SNPs at novel loci, rs112404845 (P = 3.8 x 10(-8)), upstream of COBL, and rs16961023 (P = 4.6 x 10(-8)), downstream of SLC10A2, obtained genome-wide significant evidence of association with the posterior liability. DISCUSSION: An informed conditioning approach can detect LOAD genetic associations in AAs not identified by traditional GWAS."29,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified 19 susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, understanding how these genes are involved in the pathophysiology of AD is one of the main challenges of the ""post-GWAS"" era. At least 123 genes are located within the 19 susceptibility loci; hence, a conventional approach (studying the genes one by one) would not be time- and cost-effective. We therefore developed a genome-wide, high-content siRNA screening approach and used it to assess the functional impact of gene under-expression on APP metabolism. We found that 832 genes modulated APP metabolism. Eight of these genes were located within AD susceptibility loci. Only FERMT2 (a beta3-integrin co-activator) was also significantly associated with a variation in cerebrospinal fluid Abeta peptide levels in 2886 AD cases. Lastly, we showed that the under-expression of FERMT2 increases Abeta peptide production by raising levels of mature APP at the cell surface and facilitating its recycling. Taken as a whole, our data suggest that FERMT2 modulates the AD risk by regulating APP metabolism and Abeta peptide production."30,"INTRODUCTION: Genetic loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified in whites of European ancestry, but the genetic architecture of AD among other populations is less understood. METHODS: We conducted a transethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) for late-onset AD in Stage 1 sample including whites of European Ancestry, African-Americans, Japanese, and Israeli-Arabs assembled by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium. Suggestive results from Stage 1 from novel loci were followed up using summarized results in the International Genomics Alzheimer's Project GWAS dataset. RESULTS: Genome-wide significant (GWS) associations in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based tests (P < 5 x 10(-8)) were identified for SNPs in PFDN1/HBEGF, USP6NL/ECHDC3, and BZRAP1-AS1 and for the interaction of the (apolipoprotein E) APOE epsilon4 allele with NFIC SNP. We also obtained GWS evidence (P < 2.7 x 10(-6)) for gene-based association in the total sample with a novel locus, TPBG (P = 1.8 x 10(-6)). DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the value of transethnic studies for identifying novel AD susceptibility loci."31,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether symptomatic and asymptomatic persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology have different allele counts for single-nucleotide polymorphisms that have been associated with clinical late-onset AD. METHODS: Data came from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set and Neuropathology Data Set, and the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). Participants had low to high AD neuropathologic change. The 22 known/suspected genes associated with late-onset AD were considered. ""Symptomatic"" was defined as Clinical Dementia Rating global score >0. RESULTS: Sixty-eight asymptomatic and 521 symptomatic participants met inclusion criteria. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with ABCA7 [odds ratio (OR)=1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-2.85] and MAPT (OR=2.18; CI, 1.26-3.77) were associated with symptomatic status. In stratified analyses, loci containing CD2AP (OR=0.35; 95% CI, 0.16-0.74), ZCWPW1 (OR=2.98; 95% CI, 1.34-6.86), and MAPT (OR=3.73, 95% CI, 1.30-11.76) were associated with symptomatic status in APOE e4 carriers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings potentially explain some of the variation in whether a person with AD neuropathology expresses symptoms. Understanding why some people remain cognitively normal despite having AD neuropathology could identify pathways to disease heterogeneity and guide treatment trials."32,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive functions are highly heritable and polygenic, though the source of this genetic influence is unclear. On the neurobiological level, these functions rely on effective neuroplasticity, in which the activity-regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (ARC) plays an essential role. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the ARC gene complex may contribute to the genetic components of intellectual function given the crucial role of ARC in brain plasticity and memory formation. METHODS: The ARC complex was tested for association with intelligence (IQ) in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 5,165). As Alzheimer's disease (AD) shares genetics with cognitive functioning, the association was followed up in an AD sample (17,008 cases, 37,154 controls). RESULTS: The ARC complex revealed association with verbal and total IQ (empirical p = 0.027 and 0.041, respectively) in the ALSPAC. The strongest single variant signal (rs2830077; empirical p = 0.018), within the APP gene, was confirmed in the AD sample (p = 2.76E-03). Functional analyses of this variant showed its preferential binding to the transcription factor CP2. DISCUSSION: This study implicates APP in childhood IQ. While follow-up studies are needed, this observation could help elucidate the etiology of disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction, such as AD."33,"BACKGROUND: Both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) occur commonly in the aging populations and T2D has been considered as an important risk factor for AD. The heritability of both diseases is estimated to be over 50%. However, common pleiotropic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/loci have not been well-defined. The aim of this study is to analyze two large public accessible GWAS datasets to identify novel common genetic loci for T2D and/or AD. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The recently developed novel conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) approach was used to analyze the summary GWAS datasets from International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and Diabetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) to identify novel susceptibility genes for AD and T2D. RESULTS: We identified 78 SNPs (including 58 novel SNPs) that were associated with AD in Europeans conditional on T2D (cFDR<0.05). 66 T2D SNPs (including 40 novel SNPs) were identified by conditioning on SNPs association with AD (cFDR<0.05). A conjunction-cFDR (ccFDR) analysis detected 8 pleiotropic SNPs with a significance threshold of ccFDR<0.05 for both AD and T2D, of which 5 SNPs (rs6982393, rs4734295, rs7812465, rs10510109, rs2421016) were novel findings. Furthermore, among the 8 SNPs annotated at 6 different genes, 3 corresponding genes TP53INP1, TOMM40 and C8orf38 were related to mitochondrial dysfunction, critically involved in oxidative stress, which potentially contribute to the etiology of both AD and T2D. CONCLUSION: Our study provided evidence for shared genetic loci between T2D and AD in European subjects by using cFDR and ccFDR analyses. These results may provide novel insight into the etiology and potential therapeutic targets of T2D and/or AD."34,"Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a common neurodegenerative condition associated with dementia. To learn more about genetic risk of HS-Aging pathology, we tested gene-based associations of the GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, and KCNMB2 genes, which were reported to be associated with HS-Aging pathology in previous studies. Genetic data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, linked to autopsy-derived neuropathological outcomes from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Of the 3251 subjects included in the study, 271 (8.3%) were identified as an HS-Aging case. The significant gene-based association between the ABCC9 gene and HS-Aging appeared to be driven by a region in which a significant haplotype-based association was found. We tested this haplotype as an expression quantitative trait locus using 2 different public-access brain gene expression databases. The HS-Aging pathology protective ABCC9 haplotype was associated with decreased ABCC9 expression, indicating a possible toxic gain of function."35,"Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) has a complex genetic etiology, involving locus heterogeneity, polygenic inheritance, and gene-gene interactions; however, the investigation of interactions in recent genome-wide association studies has been limited. We used a biological knowledge-driven approach to evaluate gene-gene interactions for consistency across 13 data sets from the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium. Fifteen single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-SNP pairs within 3 gene-gene combinations were identified: SIRT1 x ABCB1, PSAP x PEBP4, and GRIN2B x ADRA1A. In addition, we extend a previously identified interaction from an endophenotype analysis between RYR3 x CACNA1C. Finally, post hoc gene expression analyses of the implicated SNPs further implicate SIRT1 and ABCB1, and implicate CDH23 which was most recently identified as an AD risk locus in an epigenetic analysis of AD. The observed interactions in this article highlight ways in which genotypic variation related to disease may depend on the genetic context in which it occurs. Further, our results highlight the utility of evaluating genetic interactions to explain additional variance in AD risk and identify novel molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis."36,"Late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a genetically complex and clinically heterogeneous disease. Recent large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than twenty loci that modify risk for AD. Despite the identification of these loci, little progress has been made in identifying the functional variants that explain the association with AD risk. Thus, we sought to determine whether the novel LOAD GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) alter expression of LOAD GWAS genes and whether expression of these genes is altered in AD brains. The majority of LOAD GWAS SNPs occur in gene dense regions under large linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks, making it unclear which gene(s) are modified by the SNP. Thus, we tested for brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) between LOAD GWAS SNPs and SNPs in high LD with the LOAD GWAS SNPs in all of the genes within the GWAS loci. We found a significant eQTL between rs1476679 and PILRB and GATS, which occurs within the ZCWPW1 locus. PILRB and GATS expression levels, within the ZCWPW1 locus, were also associated with AD status. Rs7120548 was associated with MTCH2 expression, which occurs within the CELF1 locus. Additionally, expression of several genes within the CELF1 locus, including MTCH2, were highly correlated with one another and were associated with AD status. We further demonstrate that PILRB, as well as other genes within the GWAS loci, are most highly expressed in microglia. These findings together with the function of PILRB as a DAP12 receptor supports the critical role of microglia and neuroinflammation in AD risk."37,"IMPORTANCE: Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, places a large burden on families and society. Although epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests a relationship between inflammation and AD, their relationship is not well understood and could have implications for treatment and prevention strategies. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a subset of genes involved with increased risk of inflammation are also associated with increased risk for AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a genetic epidemiology study conducted in July 2015, we systematically investigated genetic overlap between AD (International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project stage 1) and Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and psoriasis using summary data from genome-wide association studies at multiple academic clinical research centers. P values and odds ratios from genome-wide association studies of more than 100000 individuals were from previous comparisons of patients vs respective control cohorts. Diagnosis for each disorder was previously established for the parent study using consensus criteria. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the pleiotropic (conjunction) false discovery rate P value. Follow-up for candidate variants included neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology; longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale scores as a measure of cognitive dysfunction (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative); and gene expression in AD vs control brains (Gene Expression Omnibus data). RESULTS: Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (false discovery rate P < .05) were associated with both AD and immune-mediated diseases. Of these, rs2516049 (closest gene HLA-DRB5; conjunction false discovery rate P = .04 for AD and psoriasis, 5.37 x 10-5 for AD, and 6.03 x 10-15 for psoriasis) and rs12570088 (closest gene IPMK; conjunction false discovery rate P = .009 for AD and Crohn disease, P = 5.73 x 10-6 for AD, and 6.57 x 10-5 for Crohn disease) demonstrated the same direction of allelic effect between AD and the immune-mediated diseases. Both rs2516049 and rs12570088 were significantly associated with neurofibrillary tangle pathology (P = .01352 and .03151, respectively); rs2516049 additionally correlated with longitudinal decline on Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale scores (beta [SE], 0.405 [0.190]; P = .03). Regarding gene expression, HLA-DRA and IPMK transcript expression was significantly altered in AD brains compared with control brains (HLA-DRA: beta [SE], 0.155 [0.024]; P = 1.97 x 10-10; IPMK: beta [SE], -0.096 [0.013]; P = 7.57 x 10-13). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our findings demonstrate genetic overlap between AD and immune-mediated diseases and suggest that immune system processes influence AD pathogenesis and progression."38,"We performed an exome-wide association analysis in 1393 late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) cases and 8141 controls from the CHARGE consortium. We found that a rare variant (P155L) in TM2D3 was enriched in Icelanders (~0.5% versus <0.05% in other European populations). In 433 LOAD cases and 3903 controls from the Icelandic AGES sub-study, P155L was associated with increased risk and earlier onset of LOAD [odds ratio (95% CI) = 7.5 (3.5-15.9), p = 6.6x10-9]. Mutation in the Drosophila TM2D3 homolog, almondex, causes a phenotype similar to loss of Notch/Presenilin signaling. Human TM2D3 is capable of rescuing these phenotypes, but this activity is abolished by P155L, establishing it as a functionally damaging allele. Our results establish a rare TM2D3 variant in association with LOAD susceptibility, and together with prior work suggests possible links to the beta-amyloid cascade."39,"INTRODUCTION: The genetics underlying posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), typically a rare variant of Alzheimer's disease (AD), remain uncertain. METHODS: We genotyped 302 PCA patients from 11 centers, calculated risk at 24 loci for AD/DLB and performed an exploratory genome-wide association study. RESULTS: We confirm that variation in/near APOE/TOMM40 (P = 6 x 10(-14)) alters PCA risk, but with smaller effect than for typical AD (PCA: odds ratio [OR] = 2.03, typical AD: OR = 2.83, P = .0007). We found evidence for risk in/near CR1 (P = 7 x 10(-4)), ABCA7 (P = .02) and BIN1 (P = .04). ORs at variants near INPP5D and NME8 did not overlap between PCA and typical AD. Exploratory genome-wide association studies confirmed APOE and identified three novel loci: rs76854344 near CNTNAP5 (P = 8 x 10(-10) OR = 1.9 [1.5-2.3]); rs72907046 near FAM46A (P = 1 x 10(-9) OR = 3.2 [2.1-4.9]); and rs2525776 near SEMA3C (P = 1 x 10(-8), OR = 3.3 [2.1-5.1]). DISCUSSION: We provide evidence for genetic risk factors specifically related to PCA. We identify three candidate loci that, if replicated, may provide insights into selective vulnerability and phenotypic diversity in AD."40,"BACKGROUND: Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) is an enzyme that is produced primarily in the prostate and functions as a cell growth regulator and potential tumor suppressor. Understanding the genetic regulation of this enzyme is important because PAP plays an important role in prostate cancer and is expressed in other tissues such as the brain. METHODS: We tested association between 5.8 M SNPs and PAP levels in cerebrospinal fluid across 543 individuals in two datasets using linear regression. We then performed meta-analyses using METAL =with a significance threshold of p < 5 x 10(-8) and removed SNPs where the direction of the effect was different between the two datasets, identifying 289 candidate SNPs that affect PAP cerebrospinal fluid levels. We analyzed each of these SNPs individually and prioritized SNPs that had biologically meaningful functional annotations in wANNOVAR (e.g. non-synonymous, stop gain, 3' UTR, etc.) or had a RegulomeDB score less than 3. RESULTS: Thirteen SNPs met our criteria, suggesting they are candidate causal alleles that underlie ACPP regulation and expression. CONCLUSIONS: Given PAP's expression in the brain and its role as a cell-growth regulator and tumor suppressor, our results have important implications in brain health such as cancer and other brain diseases including neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) and mental health (e.g., anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia)."41,"BACKGROUND: CCL16 is a chemokine predominantly expressed in the liver, but is also found in the blood and brain, and is known to play important roles in immune response and angiogenesis. Little is known about the gene's regulation. METHODS: Here, we test for potential causal SNPs that affect CCL16 protein levels in both blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in a genome-wide association study across two datasets. We then use METAL to performed meta-analyses with a significance threshold of p < 5x10(-8). We removed SNPs where the direction of the effect was different between the two datasets. RESULTS: We identify 10 SNPs associated with increased CCL16 protein levels in both biological fluids. CONCLUSIONS: Our results will help understand CCL16's regulation, allowing researchers to better understand the gene's effects on human health."42,"Intracranial volume reflects the maximally attained brain size during development, and remains stable with loss of tissue in late life. It is highly heritable, but the underlying genes remain largely undetermined. In a genome-wide association study of 32,438 adults, we discovered five previously unknown loci for intracranial volume and confirmed two known signals. Four of the loci were also associated with adult human stature, but these remained associated with intracranial volume after adjusting for height. We found a high genetic correlation with child head circumference (rhogenetic = 0.748), which indicates a similar genetic background and allowed us to identify four additional loci through meta-analysis (Ncombined = 37,345). Variants for intracranial volume were also related to childhood and adult cognitive function, and Parkinson's disease, and were enriched near genes involved in growth pathways, including PI3K-AKT signaling. These findings identify the biological underpinnings of intracranial volume and their link to physiological and pathological traits."43,"APOE varepsilon4, the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), may mask effects of other loci. We re-analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) Consortium in APOE varepsilon4+ (10 352 cases and 9207 controls) and APOE varepsilon4- (7184 cases and 26 968 controls) subgroups as well as in the total sample testing for interaction between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and APOE varepsilon4 status. Suggestive associations (P<1 x 10(-4)) in stage 1 were evaluated in an independent sample (stage 2) containing 4203 subjects (APOE varepsilon4+: 1250 cases and 536 controls; APOE varepsilon4-: 718 cases and 1699 controls). Among APOE varepsilon4- subjects, novel genome-wide significant (GWS) association was observed with 17 SNPs (all between KANSL1 and LRRC37A on chromosome 17 near MAPT) in a meta-analysis of the stage 1 and stage 2 data sets (best SNP, rs2732703, P=5.8 x 10(-9)). Conditional analysis revealed that rs2732703 accounted for association signals in the entire 100-kilobase region that includes MAPT. Except for previously identified AD loci showing stronger association in APOE varepsilon4+ subjects (CR1 and CLU) or APOE varepsilon4- subjects (MS4A6A/MS4A4A/MS4A6E), no other SNPs were significantly associated with AD in a specific APOE genotype subgroup. In addition, the finding in the stage 1 sample that AD risk is significantly influenced by the interaction of APOE with rs1595014 in TMEM106B (P=1.6 x 10(-7)) is noteworthy, because TMEM106B variants have previously been associated with risk of frontotemporal dementia. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that rs113986870, one of the GWS SNPs near rs2732703, is significantly associated with four KANSL1 probes that target transcription of the first translated exon and an untranslated exon in hippocampus (P 1.3 x 10(-8)), frontal cortex (P 1.3 x 10(-9)) and temporal cortex (P1.2 x 10(-11)). Rs113986870 is also strongly associated with a MAPT probe that targets transcription of alternatively spliced exon 3 in frontal cortex (P=9.2 x 10(-6)) and temporal cortex (P=2.6 x 10(-6)). Our APOE-stratified GWAS is the first to show GWS association for AD with SNPs in the chromosome 17q21.31 region. Replication of this finding in independent samples is needed to verify that SNPs in this region have significantly stronger effects on AD risk in persons lacking APOE varepsilon4 compared with persons carrying this allele, and if this is found to hold, further examination of this region and studies aimed at deciphering the mechanism(s) are warranted."44,"OBJECTIVE: The epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest known common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and alters age of onset in retrospective studies. Here, we longitudinally test the effects of APOE epsilon4 genotype and age during progression from normal cognition to AD. METHODS: Using data from 5381 cognitively normal older individuals and Cox proportional hazards models, we longitudinally tested the effects of APOE genotype on progression from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD in four age strata (<60, 60-70, 70-80, 80 + ) and with a sliding window approach between ages 60 and 85. RESULTS: We found that APOE epsilon4 carrier status and dosage significantly influenced progression to MCI or AD in all four age groups and that APOE epsilon4-associated progression risk peaked between ages 70 and 75. We confirmed APOE epsilon4-associated progression risk in a subset of the cohort with pathologically proven diagnoses. INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that in clinically normal individuals, APOE epsilon4 status significantly predicts progression to MCI or AD across older adulthood and that this risk varies with age. This information will be useful as therapeutic interventions become available and clinical decisions can be individually tailored based on age and genetic data."45,"Genome-wide association studies have associated clusterin (CLU) variants with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of CLU on AD pathogenesis is not totally understood. We used cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma CLU levels as endophenotypes for genetic studies to understand the role of CLU in AD. CSF, but not plasma, CLU levels were significantly associated with AD status and CSF tau/amyloid-beta ratio, and highly correlated with CSF apolipoprotein E (APOE) levels. Several loci showed almost genome-wide significant associations including LINC00917 (p = 3.98 x 10(-7)) and interleukin 6 (IL6, p = 9.94 x 10(-6), in the entire data set and in the APOE epsilon4- individuals p = 7.40 x 10(-8)). Gene ontology analyses suggest that CSF CLU levels may be associated with wound healing and immune response which supports previous functional studies that demonstrated an association between CLU and IL6. CLU may play a role in AD by influencing immune system changes that have been observed in AD or by disrupting healing after neurodegeneration."46,"BACKGROUND: Prolactin is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland that plays an essential role in lactation, tissue growth, and suppressing apoptosis to increase cell survival. Prolactin serves as a key player in many life-critical processes, including immune system and reproduction. Prolactin is also found in multiple fluids throughout the body, including plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). METHODS: In this study, we measured prolactin levels in both plasma and CSF, and performed a genome-wide association study. We then performed meta-analyses using METAL with a significance threshold of p < 5 x 10(-8) and removed SNPs where the direction of the effect was different between the two datasets. RESULTS: We identified 12 SNPs associated with increased prolactin levels in both biological fluids. CONCLUSIONS: Our efforts will help researchers understand how prolactin is regulated in both CSF and plasma, which could be beneficial in research for the immune system and reproduction."47,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology appears several years before clinical symptoms, so identifying ways to detect individuals in the preclinical stage is imperative. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Tau/Abeta42 ratio is currently the best known predictor of AD status and cognitive decline, and the ratio of CSF levels of chitinase-3-like 1 protein (CHI3L1, YKL-40) and amyloid beta (Abeta42) were reported as predictive, but individual variability and group overlap inhibits their utility for individual diagnosis making it necessary to find ways to improve sensitivity of these biomarkers. METHODS: We used linear regression to identify genetic loci associated with CSF YKL-40 levels in 379 individuals (80 cognitively impaired and 299 cognitively normal) from the Charles F and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. We tested correlations between YKL-40 and CSF Tau/Abeta42 ratio, Abeta42, tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181). We used studentized residuals from a linear regression model of the log-transformed, standardized protein levels and the additive reference allele counts from the most significant locus to adjust YKL-40 values and tested the differences in correlations with CSF Tau/Abeta42 ratio, Abeta42, tau, and ptau181. RESULTS: We found that genetic variants on the CH13L1 locus were significantly associated with CSF YKL-40 levels, but not AD risk, age at onset, or disease progression. The most significant variant is a reported expression quantitative trait locus for CHI3L1, the gene which encodes YKL-40, and explained 12.74 % of the variance in CSF YKL-40 in our study. YKL-40 was positively correlated with ptau181 (r = 0.521) and the strength of the correlation significantly increased with the addition of genetic information (r = 0.573, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: CSF YKL-40 levels are likely a biomarker for AD, but we found no evidence that they are an AD endophenotype. YKL-40 levels are highly regulated by genetic variation, and by including genetic information the strength of the correlation between YKL-40 and ptau181 levels is significantly improved. Our results suggest that studies of potential biomarkers may benefit from including genetic information."48,"We investigated the genetic overlap between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Using summary statistics (P-values) from large recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (total n=89 904 individuals), we sought to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associating with both AD and PD. We found and replicated association of both AD and PD with the A allele of rs393152 within the extended MAPT region on chromosome 17 (meta analysis P-value across five independent AD cohorts=1.65 x 10(-7)). In independent datasets, we found a dose-dependent effect of the A allele of rs393152 on intra-cerebral MAPT transcript levels and volume loss within the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Our findings identify the tau-associated MAPT locus as a site of genetic overlap between AD and PD, and extending prior work, we show that the MAPT region increases risk of Alzheimer's neurodegeneration."49,"There is a strong genetic basis for late-onset of Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), and thus far >20 genes/loci have been identified that affect the risk of LOAD. In addition to disease risk, genetic variation at these loci may also affect components of the natural history of AD, such as survival in AD. In this study, we first examined the role of known LOAD genes with survival time in 983 AD patients. We then performed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and gene-based association analyses to identify novel loci that may influence survival of AD. Survival analysis was conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression under an additive genetics model. We found multiple nominally significant associations (p < 0.01) either within or adjacent to known LOAD genes. Genome-wide SNP analysis identified multiple suggestive novel loci and two of them were also significant in gene-based analysis (CCDC85C and NARS2) that survived after controlling for false-discovery rate at 0.05. In summary, we have identified two novel genes for survival in AD that need to be replicated in independent samples. Our findings highlight the importance of focusing on AD-related phenotypes that may help to identify additional genes relevant toAD."50,"Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a common high-morbidity neurodegenerative condition in elderly persons. To understand the risk factors for HS-Aging, we analyzed data from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium and correlated the data with clinical and pathologic information from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Overall, 268 research volunteers with HS-Aging and 2,957 controls were included; detailed neuropathologic data were available for all. The study focused on single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with HS-Aging risk: rs5848 (GRN), rs1990622 (TMEM106B), and rs704180 (ABCC9). Analyses of a subsample that was not previously evaluated (51 HS-Aging cases and 561 controls) replicated the associations of previously identified HS-Aging risk alleles. To test for evidence of gene-gene interactions and genotype-phenotype relationships, pooled data were analyzed. The risk for HS-Aging diagnosis associated with these genetic polymorphisms was not secondary to an association with either Alzheimer disease or dementia with Lewy body neuropathologic changes. The presence of multiple risk genotypes was associated with a trend for additive risk for HS-Aging pathology. We conclude that multiple genes play important roles in HS-Aging, which is a distinctive neurodegenerative disease of aging."51,"OBJECTIVE: To minimize pathologic heterogeneity in genetic studies of Parkinson disease (PD), the Autopsy-Confirmed Parkinson Disease Genetics Consortium conducted a genome-wide association study using both patients with neuropathologically confirmed PD and controls. METHODS: Four hundred eighty-four cases and 1,145 controls met neuropathologic diagnostic criteria, were genotyped, and then imputed to 3,922,209 variants for genome-wide association study analysis. RESULTS: A small region on chromosome 1 was strongly associated with PD (rs10788972; p = 6.2 x 10(-8)). The association peak lies within and very close to the maximum linkage peaks of 2 prior positive linkage studies defining the PARK10 locus. We demonstrate that rs10788972 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs914722, the single nucleotide polymorphism defining the PARK10 haplotype previously shown to be significantly associated with age at onset in PD. The region containing the PARK10 locus was significantly reduced from 10.6 megabases to 100 kilobases and contains 4 known genes: TCEANC2, TMEM59, miR-4781, and LDLRAD1. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the association of a PARK10 haplotype with the risk of developing idiopathic PD. Furthermore, we significantly reduce the size of the PARK10 region. None of the candidate genes in the new PARK10 region have been previously implicated in the biology of PD, suggesting new areas of potential research. This study strongly suggests that reducing pathologic heterogeneity may enhance the application of genetic association studies to PD."52,"The CD33 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3865444 has been associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rs3865444 is in linkage disequilibrium with rs12459419 which has been associated with efficacy of an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) chemotherapeutic agent based on a CD33 antibody. We seek to evaluate the extent to which CD33 genetics in AD and AML can inform one another and advance human disease therapy. We have previously shown that these SNPs are associated with skipping of CD33 exon 2 in brain mRNA. Here, we report that these CD33 SNPs are associated with exon 2 skipping in leukocytes from AML patients and with a novel CD33 splice variant that retains CD33 intron 1. Each copy of the minor rs12459419T allele decreases prototypic full-length CD33 expression by approximately 25% and decreases the AD odds ratio by approximately 0.10. These results suggest that CD33 antagonists may be useful in reducing AD risk. CD33 inhibitors may include humanized CD33 antibodies such as lintuzumab which was safe but ineffective in AML clinical trials. Here, we report that lintuzumab downregulates cell-surface CD33 by 80% in phorbol-ester differentiated U937 cells, at concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml. Overall, we propose a model wherein a modest effect on RNA splicing is sufficient to mediate the CD33 association with AD risk and suggest the potential for an anti-CD33 antibody as an AD-relevant pharmacologic agent."53,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological findings suggest a relationship between Alzheimer disease (AD), inflammation, and dyslipidemia, although the nature of this relationship is not well understood. We investigated whether this phenotypic association arises from a shared genetic basis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using summary statistics (P values and odds ratios) from genome-wide association studies of >200 000 individuals, we investigated overlap in single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with clinically diagnosed AD and C-reactive protein (CRP), triglycerides, and high- and low-density lipoprotein levels. We found up to 50-fold enrichment of AD single-nucleotide polymorphisms for different levels of association with C-reactive protein, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride single-nucleotide polymorphisms using a false discovery rate threshold <0.05. By conditioning on polymorphisms associated with the 4 phenotypes, we identified 55 loci associated with increased AD risk. We then conducted a meta-analysis of these 55 variants across 4 independent AD cohorts (total: n=29 054 AD cases and 114 824 healthy controls) and discovered 2 genome-wide significant variants on chromosome 4 (rs13113697; closest gene, HS3ST1; odds ratio=1.07; 95% confidence interval=1.05-1.11; P=2.86x10(-8)) and chromosome 10 (rs7920721; closest gene, ECHDC3; odds ratio=1.07; 95% confidence interval=1.04-1.11; P=3.38x10(-8)). We also found that gene expression of HS3ST1 and ECHDC3 was altered in AD brains compared with control brains. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate genetic overlap between AD, C-reactive protein, and plasma lipids. By conditioning on the genetic association with the cardiovascular phenotypes, we identify novel AD susceptibility loci, including 2 genome-wide significant variants conferring increased risk for AD."54,"Observational research shows that higher body mass index (BMI) increases Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but it is unclear whether this association is causal. We applied genetic variants that predict BMI in Mendelian randomization analyses, an approach that is not biased by reverse causation or confounding, to evaluate whether higher BMI increases AD risk. We evaluated individual-level data from the AD Genetics Consortium (ADGC: 10,079 AD cases and 9613 controls), the Health and Retirement Study (HRS: 8403 participants with algorithm-predicted dementia status), and published associations from the Genetic and Environmental Risk for AD consortium (GERAD1: 3177 AD cases and 7277 controls). No evidence from individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms or polygenic scores indicated BMI increased AD risk. Mendelian randomization effect estimates per BMI point (95% confidence intervals) were as follows: ADGC, odds ratio (OR) = 0.95 (0.90-1.01); HRS, OR = 1.00 (0.75-1.32); GERAD1, OR = 0.96 (0.87-1.07). One subscore (cellular processes not otherwise specified) unexpectedly predicted lower AD risk."55,"OBJECTIVE: Although a number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) have been carried out, there have been little GWAS data on East Asian populations. DESIGN: To discover the novel susceptibility loci of LOAD, we carried out a GWAS using 816 LOAD cases and 7992 controls with a replication analysis using an independent panel of 1011 LOAD cases and 7212 controls in a Japanese population. In addition, we carried out a stratified analysis by APOE-epsilon4 status to eliminate the established effect of APOE region. RESULTS: Our data indicated that 18p11.32 (rs1992269, P = 9.77 x 10(-7)), CNTNAP2 (rs802571, P = 1.26 x 10(-6)), and 12q24.23 (rs11613092, P = 6.85 x 10(-6)) were suggestive loci for susceptibility to LOAD. CONCLUSION: We identified three suggestive loci for susceptibility to LOAD in a Japanese population. Among these, rs802571, located at intron 1 of CNTNAP2, was considered to be a plausible candidate locus from a functional perspective."56,"OBJECTIVE: In the context of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) over 20 genes have been identified but, aside APOE, all show small effect sizes, leaving a large part of the genetic component unexplained. Admixed populations, such as Caribbean Hispanics, can provide a valuable contribution because of their unique genetic profile and higher incidence of the disease. We aimed to identify novel loci associated with LOAD. METHODS: About 4514 unrelated Caribbean Hispanics (2451 cases and 2063 controls) were selected for genome-wide association analysis. Significant loci were further tested in the expanded cohort that also included related family members (n = 5300). Two AD-like transgenic mice models (J20 and rTg4510) were used to study gene expression. Independent data sets of non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans were used to further validate findings, along with publicly available brain expression data sets. RESULTS: A novel locus, rs75002042 in FBXL7 (5p15.1), was found genome-wide significant in the case-control cohort (odd ratio [OR] = 0.61, P = 6.19E-09) and confirmed in the related members cohorts (OR = 0.63, P = 4.7E-08). Fbxl7 protein was overexpressed in both AD-like transgenic mice compared to wild-type littermates. Publicly available microarray studies also showed significant overexpression of Fbxl7 in LOAD brains compared to nondemented controls. single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs75002042 was in complete linkage disequilibrium with other variants in two independent non-Hispanic White and African American data sets (0.0005 < P < 0.02) used for replication. INTERPRETATION: FBXL7, encodes a subcellular protein involved in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination processes and displays proapoptotic activity. F-box proteins also modulate inflammation and innate immunity, which may be important in LOAD pathogenesis. Further investigations are needed to validate and understand its role in this and other populations."57,"INTRODUCTION: MAPT encodes for tau, the predominant component of neurofibrillary tangles that are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic association of MAPT variants with late-onset AD (LOAD) risk has been inconsistent, although insufficient power and incomplete assessment of MAPT haplotypes may account for this. METHODS: We examined the association of MAPT haplotypes with LOAD risk in more than 20,000 subjects (n-cases = 9,814, n-controls = 11,550) from Mayo Clinic (n-cases = 2,052, n-controls = 3,406) and the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC, n-cases = 7,762, n-controls = 8,144). We also assessed associations with brain MAPT gene expression levels measured in the cerebellum (n = 197) and temporal cortex (n = 202) of LOAD subjects. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which tag MAPT haplotypes with frequencies greater than 1% were evaluated. RESULTS: H2-haplotype tagging rs8070723-G allele associated with reduced risk of LOAD (odds ratio, OR = 0.90, 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.85-0.95, p = 5.2E-05) with consistent results in the Mayo (OR = 0.81, p = 7.0E-04) and ADGC (OR = 0.89, p = 1.26E-04) cohorts. rs3785883-A allele was also nominally significantly associated with LOAD risk (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01-1.13, p = 0.034). Haplotype analysis revealed significant global association with LOAD risk in the combined cohort (p = 0.033), with significant association of the H2 haplotype with reduced risk of LOAD as expected (p = 1.53E-04) and suggestive association with additional haplotypes. MAPT SNPs and haplotypes also associated with brain MAPT levels in the cerebellum and temporal cortex of AD subjects with the strongest associations observed for the H2 haplotype and reduced brain MAPT levels (beta = -0.16 to -0.20, p = 1.0E-03 to 3.0E-03). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the previously reported MAPT H2 associations with LOAD risk in two large series, that this haplotype has the strongest effect on brain MAPT expression amongst those tested and identify additional haplotypes with suggestive associations, which require replication in independent series. These biologically congruent results provide compelling evidence to screen the MAPT region for regulatory variants which confer LOAD risk by influencing its brain gene expression."58,"To follow-up loci discovered by the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Disease Project, we attempted independent replication of 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large Spanish sample (Fundacio ACE data set; 1808 patients and 2564 controls). Our results corroborate association with four SNPs located in the genes INPP5D, MEF2C, ZCWPW1 and FERMT2, respectively. Of these, ZCWPW1 was the only SNP to withstand correction for multiple testing (P=0.000655). Furthermore, we identify TRIP4 (rs74615166) as a novel genome-wide significant locus for Alzheimer's disease risk (odds ratio=1.31; confidence interval 95% (1.19-1.44); P=9.74 x 10(-)(9))."59,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a common debilitating dementia with known heritability, for which 20 late onset susceptibility loci have been identified, but more remain to be discovered. This study sought to identify new susceptibility genes, using an alternative gene-wide analytical approach which tests for patterns of association within genes, in the powerful genome-wide association dataset of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project Consortium, comprising over 7 m genotypes from 25,580 Alzheimer's cases and 48,466 controls. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In addition to earlier reported genes, we detected genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 8 (TP53INP1, p = 1.4x10-6) and 14 (IGHV1-67 p = 7.9x10-8) which indexed novel susceptibility loci. SIGNIFICANCE: The additional genes identified in this study, have an array of functions previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease, including aspects of energy metabolism, protein degradation and the immune system and add further weight to these pathways as potential therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease."60,"Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a high-morbidity brain disease in the elderly but risk factors are largely unknown. We report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) with HS-Aging pathology as an endophenotype. In collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, data were analyzed from large autopsy cohorts: (#1) National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC); (#2) Rush University Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; (#3) Group Health Research Institute Adult Changes in Thought study; (#4) University of California at Irvine 90+ Study; and (#5) University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center. Altogether, 363 HS-Aging cases and 2,303 controls, all pathologically confirmed, provided statistical power to test for risk alleles with large effect size. A two-tier study design included GWAS from cohorts #1-3 (Stage I) to identify promising SNP candidates, followed by focused evaluation of particular SNPs in cohorts #4-5 (Stage II). Polymorphism in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9 (ABCC9) gene, also known as sulfonylurea receptor 2, was associated with HS-Aging pathology. In the meta-analyzed Stage I GWAS, ABCC9 polymorphisms yielded the lowest p values, and factoring in the Stage II results, the meta-analyzed risk SNP (rs704178:G) attained genome-wide statistical significance (p = 1.4 x 10(-9)), with odds ratio (OR) of 2.13 (recessive mode of inheritance). For SNPs previously linked to hippocampal sclerosis, meta-analyses of Stage I results show OR = 1.16 for rs5848 (GRN) and OR = 1.22 rs1990622 (TMEM106B), with the risk alleles as previously described. Sulfonylureas, a widely prescribed drug class used to treat diabetes, also modify human ABCC9 protein function. A subsample of patients from the NACC database (n = 624) were identified who were older than age 85 at death with known drug history. Controlling for important confounders such as diabetes itself, exposure to a sulfonylurea drug was associated with risk for HS-Aging pathology (p = 0.03). Thus, we describe a novel and targetable dementia risk factor."61,"IMPORTANCE: Because APOE locus variants contribute to risk of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) and to differences in age at onset (AAO), it is important to know whether other established LOAD risk loci also affect AAO in affected participants. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of known Alzheimer disease risk loci in modifying AAO and to estimate their cumulative effect on AAO variation using data from genome-wide association studies in the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium comprises 14 case-control, prospective, and family-based data sets with data on 9162 participants of white race/ethnicity with Alzheimer disease occurring after age 60 years who also had complete AAO information, gathered between 1989 and 2011 at multiple sites by participating studies. Data on genotyped or imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms most significantly associated with risk at 10 confirmed LOAD loci were examined in linear modeling of AAO, and individual data set results were combined using a random-effects, inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis approach to determine whether they contribute to variation in AAO. Aggregate effects of all risk loci on AAO were examined in a burden analysis using genotype scores weighted by risk effect sizes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age at disease onset abstracted from medical records among participants with LOAD diagnosed per standard criteria. RESULTS: Analysis confirmed the association of APOE with earlier AAO (P = 3.3 x 10(-96)), with associations in CR1 (rs6701713, P = 7.2 x 10(-4)), BIN1 (rs7561528, P = 4.8 x 10(-4)), and PICALM (rs561655, P = 2.2 x 10(-3)) reaching statistical significance (P < .005). Risk alleles individually reduced AAO by 3 to 6 months. Burden analyses demonstrated that APOE contributes to 3.7% of the variation in AAO (R(2) = 0.256) over baseline (R(2) = 0.221), whereas the other 9 loci together contribute to 2.2% of the variation (R(2) = 0.242). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We confirmed an association of APOE (OMIM 107741) variants with AAO among affected participants with LOAD and observed novel associations of CR1 (OMIM 120620), BIN1 (OMIM 601248), and PICALM (OMIM 603025) with AAO. In contrast to earlier hypothetical modeling, we show that the combined effects of Alzheimer disease risk variants on AAO are on the scale of, but do not exceed, the APOE effect. While the aggregate effects of risk loci on AAO may be significant, additional genetic contributions to AAO are individually likely to be small."62,"BACKGROUND: Less is known about the genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in African Americans (AAs) than in non-Hispanic whites. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on seven AA AD cases. Disease association with potentially AD-related variants from WES was assessed in an AA discovery cohort of 422 cases and 394 controls. Replication was sought in an AA sample of 1037 cases and 1869 controls from the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). RESULTS: Forty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from WES passed filtering criteria and were successfully genotyped. Nominally significant (P < .05) association to AD was observed with two African-descent specific AKAP9 SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium: rs144662445 (P = .014) and rs149979685 (P = .037). These associations were replicated in the ADGC sample (rs144662445: P = .0022, odds ratio [OR] = 2.75; rs149979685: P = .0022, OR = 3.61). CONCLUSIONS: Because AKAP9 was not previously linked to AD risk, this study indicates a potential new disease mechanism."63,"BACKGROUND: Substantial interindividual variability exists in the disease trajectories of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Some decline rapidly whereas others decline slowly, and there are no known explanations for this variability. We describe the first genome-wide association study to examine rate of cognitive decline in a sample of AD patients with longitudinal measures of cognition. METHODS: The discovery sample was 303 AD cases recruited in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the replication sample was 323 AD cases from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In the discovery sample, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale responses were tested for association with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linear regression. We tested the 65 most significant SNPs from the discovery sample for association in the replication sample. RESULTS: We identified SNPs in the spondin 1 gene (SPON1), the minor alleles of which were significantly associated with a slower rate of decline (rs11023139, P = 7.0 x 10(-11)) in the discovery sample. A SPON1 SNP 5.5 kb upstream was associated with decline in the replication sample (rs11606345, P = .002). CONCLUSION: SPON1 has not been previously associated with AD risk, but is plausibly related because the gene product binds to the amyloid precursor protein and inhibits its cleavage by beta-secretase. These data suggest that SPON1 may be associated with the differential rate of cognitive decline in AD."64,"Several lines of inquiry point to overlapping molecular mechanisms between late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We evaluated summarized results from large genome-wide association studies for AD and AMD to test the hypothesis that AD susceptibility loci are also associated with AMD. We observed association of both disorders with genes in a region of chromosome 7, including PILRA and ZCWPW1 (peak AMD SNP rs7792525, minor allele frequency [MAF] = 19%, odds ratio [OR] = 1.14, p = 2.34 x 10(-6)), and with ABCA7 (peak AMD SNP rs3752228, MAF = 0.054, OR = 1.22, p = 0.00012). Next, we evaluated association of AMD with genes in AD-related pathways identified by canonical pathway analysis of AD-associated genes. Significant associations were observed with multiple previously identified AMD risk loci and 2 novel genes: HGS (peak SNP rs8070488, MAF = 0.23, OR = 0.91, p = 7.52 x 10(-5)), which plays a role in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling pathway, and TNF (peak SNP rs2071590, MAF = 0.34, OR = 0.89, p = 1.17 x 10(-5)), which is a member of the atherosclerosis signaling and the LXR/RXR activation pathways. Our results suggest that AMD and AD share genetic mechanisms."65,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias are a major public health challenge and present a therapeutic imperative for which we need additional insight into molecular pathogenesis. We performed a genome-wide association study and analysis of known genetic risk loci for AD dementia using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs), and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD with a number of variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). GalNAc transferase 7 (GALNT7), ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family G (WHITE), Member 1 (ABCG1), and an intergenic region on chromosome 9 were associated with NP score; and Potassium Large Conductance Calcium-Activated Channel, Subfamily M, Beta Member 2 (KCNMB2) was strongly associated with HS. Twelve of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in our clinico-pathologic sample: CR1, BIN1, CLU, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, PTK2B, SORL1, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and CASS4 with 9 of these 12 loci showing larger odds ratio in the clinico-pathologic sample. Correlation of effect sizes for risk of AD dementia with effect size for NFTs or NPs showed positive correlation, while those for risk of VBI showed a moderate negative correlation. The other co-morbid neuropathologic features showed only nominal association with the known AD loci. Our results discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features and aligned known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias."66,"OBJECTIVE: Much of the genetic basis for Alzheimer disease (AD) is unexplained. We sought to identify novel AD loci using a unique family-based approach that can detect robust associations with infrequent variants (minor allele frequency < 0.10). METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study in the Framingham Heart Study (discovery) and NIA-LOAD (National Institute on Aging-Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease) Study (replication) family-based cohorts using an approach that accounts for family structure and calculates a risk score for AD as the outcome. Links between the most promising gene candidate and AD pathogenesis were explored in silico as well as experimentally in cell-based models and in human brain. RESULTS: Genome-wide significant association was identified with a PLXNA4 single nucleotide polymorphism (rs277470) located in a region encoding the semaphorin-3A (SEMA3A) binding domain (meta-analysis p value [meta-P] = 4.1 x 10(-8) ). A test for association with the entire region was also significant (meta-P = 3.2 x 10(-4) ). Transfection of SH-SY5Y cells or primary rat neurons with full-length PLXNA4 (TS1) increased tau phosphorylation with stimulated by SEMA3A. The opposite effect was observed when cells were transfected with shorter isoforms (TS2 and TS3). However, transfection of any isoform into HEK293 cells stably expressing amyloid beta (Abeta) precursor protein (APP) did not result in differential effects on APP processing or Abeta production. Late stage AD cases (n = 9) compared to controls (n = 5) had 1.9-fold increased expression of TS1 in cortical brain tissue (p = 1.6 x 10(-4) ). Expression of TS1 was significantly correlated with the Clinical Dementia Rating score (rho = 0.75, p = 2.2 x 10(-4) ), plaque density (rho = 0.56, p = 0.01), and Braak stage (rho = 0.54, p = 0.02). INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that PLXNA4 has a role in AD pathogenesis through isoform-specific effects on tau phosphorylation."67,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 42 amino acid species of amyloid beta (Abeta42) and tau levels are strongly correlated with the presence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology including amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration and have been successfully used as endophenotypes for genetic studies of AD. Additional CSF analytes may also serve as useful endophenotypes that capture other aspects of AD pathophysiology. Here we have conducted a genome-wide association study of CSF levels of 59 AD-related analytes. All analytes were measured using the Rules Based Medicine Human DiscoveryMAP Panel, which includes analytes relevant to several disease-related processes. Data from two independently collected and measured datasets, the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), were analyzed separately, and combined results were obtained using meta-analysis. We identified genetic associations with CSF levels of 5 proteins (Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4), Interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) and Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3)) with study-wide significant p-values (p<1.46x10-10) and significant, consistent evidence for association in both the Knight ADRC and the ADNI samples. These proteins are involved in amyloid processing and pro-inflammatory signaling. SNPs associated with ACE, IL6R and MMP3 protein levels are located within the coding regions of the corresponding structural gene. The SNPs associated with CSF levels of CCL4 and CCL2 are located in known chemokine binding proteins. The genetic associations reported here are novel and suggest mechanisms for genetic control of CSF and plasma levels of these disease-related proteins. Significant SNPs in ACE and MMP3 also showed association with AD risk. Our findings suggest that these proteins/pathways may be valuable therapeutic targets for AD. Robust associations in cognitively normal individuals suggest that these SNPs also influence regulation of these proteins more generally and may therefore be relevant to other diseases."68,"Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) and phosphorylated Tau at position 181 (pTau181) are biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed an analysis and meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data on Abeta1-42 and pTau181 in AD dementia patients followed by independent replication. An association was found between Abeta1-42 level and a single-nucleotide polymorphism in SUCLG2 (rs62256378) (P = 2.5x10(-12)). An interaction between APOE genotype and rs62256378 was detected (P = 9.5 x 10(-5)), with the strongest effect being observed in APOE-epsilon4 noncarriers. Clinically, rs62256378 was associated with rate of cognitive decline in AD dementia patients (P = 3.1 x 10(-3)). Functional microglia experiments showed that SUCLG2 was involved in clearance of Abeta1-42."69,"The molecular pathways underlying age-related memory changes remain unclear. There is a substantial genetic contribution to memory performance through life span. A recent study has implicated RbAp48, which mediates its effect on age-related memory decline by interacting with cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element binding protein (CREB)1 binding protein and influencing this histone acetylation pathway. To validate these findings, we tested whether genetic variants in RbAp48, CREB1, and CREBBP are associated with memory performance in 3 independent data sets consisting of 2674 cognitively healthy elderly individuals. Genetic variant rs2526690 in the CREBBP gene was significantly associated with episodic memory performance (pmeta = 3.7 x 10(-4)) in a multivariate model adjusted for age, sex, and apolipoprotein E status. Identifying genetic variants that modulate mechanisms of cognitive aging will allow identifying valid targets for therapeutic intervention."70,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified several risk loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, these loci do not explain the entire susceptibility of the disease, suggesting that other genetic contributions remain to be identified. Here, we performed a meta-analysis combining data of 4,569 individuals (2,540 cases and 2,029 healthy controls) derived from three publicly available GWAS in AD and replicated a broad genomic region (>248,000 bp) associated with the disease near the APOE/TOMM40 locus in chromosome 19. To detect minor effect size contributions that could help to explain the remaining genetic risk, we conducted network-based pathway analyses either by extracting gene-wise p-values (GW), defined as the single strongest association signal within a gene, or calculated a more stringent gene-based association p-value using the extended Simes (GATES) procedure. Comparison of these strategies revealed that ontological sub-networks (SNs) involved in glutamate signaling were significantly overrepresented in AD (p<2.7x10(-11), p<1.9x10(-11); GW and GATES, respectively). Notably, glutamate signaling SNs were also found to be significantly overrepresented (p<5.1x10(-8)) in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, which was used as a targeted replication sample. Interestingly, components of the glutamate signaling SNs are coordinately expressed in disease-related tissues, which are tightly related to known pathological hallmarks of AD. Our findings suggest that genetic variation within glutamate signaling contributes to the remaining genetic risk of AD and support the notion that functional biological networks should be targeted in future therapies aimed to prevent or treat this devastating neurological disorder."
